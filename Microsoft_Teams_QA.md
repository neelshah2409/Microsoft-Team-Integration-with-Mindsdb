## To test the Microsoft Teams integration with MindsDB using the code you provided, you would first need to create a new MindsDB database connected to Microsoft Teams. You can do this using the following command:

`CREATE DATABASE teams_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'teams',
PARAMETERS = {
  "webhook_url": "https://..."
};
`
- Once the database has been created, we can start sending messages to your Teams channel using the following INSERT statement:

`INSERT INTO teams_datasource.messages (title, text)
VALUES ('Hello', 'World');
`
- This will send a single message to your Teams channel with the title "Hello" and the body "World".

- We can also send multiple messages in a single query using the following INSERT statement:

`INSERT INTO teams_datasource.messages (title, text)
VALUES 
('Hello', 'World'),
('Hello', 'MindsDB');
`
- This will send two messages to your Teams channel, one with the title "Hello" and the body "World" and the other with the title "Hello" and the body "MindsDB".

- Here is an example of the output that we would see in your Teams channel after running the above code:
  
`
**Hello**`

World

`**Hello**
`

MindsDB

## The Microsoft Teams integration with MindsDB can be used to automate a variety of tasks, such as:

    Sending notifications to your team members whenever a new task is assigned to them in MindsDB.
    Generating weekly reports of all completed tasks in MindsDB.
    Creating a bot that can answer questions about your MindsDB data.
